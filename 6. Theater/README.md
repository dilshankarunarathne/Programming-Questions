### Difficulty: Medium

The owner of a monopolistic movie theater in a small town has 
complete freedom in setting ticket prices.  The more he charges, the 
fewer people can afford tickets.  The less he charges, the more it 
costs to run a show because attendance goes up.  In a recent 
experiment the owner determined a relationship between the price of 
a ticket and average attendance.

At a price of $5.00/ticket, 120 people attend a performance. For 
each 10-cent change in the ticket price, the average attendance 
changes by 15 people.  That is, if the owner charges $5.10, some 105 
people attend on the average; if the price goes down to $4.90, 
average attendance increases to 135.

Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased 
cost.  Every performance comes at a fixed cost of $180 to the owner 
plus a variable cost of $0.04 per attendee.

The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit 
and ticket price in order to maximize the profit.

Write a program to figure out the best ticket price (to the nearest 
10 cents) that maximizes profit.
